# Naive-Bayes-classifier-for-Fake-News-recognition
This is the final project of Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis

## Language:
R

## Description:
Fake news are defined by the New York Times as "a made-up story with an intention to deceive", with the intent to confuse or deceive people. 
They are everywhere in our daily life, and come especially from social media platforms and applications in the online world. 
Being able to distinguish fake contents form real news is today one of the most serious challenges facing the news industry.
In this project we use Multinomial Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm to do the text classification. 
We implement this technique by using two different datasets, the first dataset is composed of 6 classes 
and the second one is only 2 classes but with larger number of data.
